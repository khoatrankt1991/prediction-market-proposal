- NO dynamic spread management
- NO inventory rebalancing systems
- NO sophisticated liquidity provision tools

**❌ Professional Trading Features:**
- NO advanced order types (stop-loss, take-profit, IOC, FOK)
- NO professional risk management systems
- NO HFT optimizations and sub-millisecond matching
- NO algorithmic trading support
- NO advanced portfolio analytics
- **NO price charts and technical analysis**
- **NO historical price data visualization**
- **NO TradingView integration**

**❌ Production-Grade Infrastructure:**
- NO 99.9% uptime guarantees
- NO professional customer support
- NO KYC/AML compliance systems
